# Hereâ€™s a Python script for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division without using functions:

# Addition
x = 10
y = 5
addition = x + y
print(f"Addition: {x} + {y} = {addition}")

# Subtraction
subtraction = x - y
print(f"Subtraction: {x} - {y} = {subtraction}")

# Multiplication
multiplication = x * y
print(f"Multiplication: {x} * {y} = {multiplication}")

# Division
division = x / y
print(f"Division: {x} / {y} = {division}")
